# AI-Powered Medical Assistant  

## Overview  
The **AI-Powered Medical Assistant** is an advanced AI-driven healthcare solution that utilizes **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **multimodal LLMs** to provide precise **medical insights**. Users can **submit text-based queries** or **upload medical images** for AI-driven analysis, enhancing **diagnostic accuracy** and medical decision-making.  

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features  
- **AI-Powered Medical Insights**: Supports both **text and image-based** medical queries.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhances accuracy by retrieving relevant medical knowledge before generating responses.  
- **Multimodal LLM Integration**: Uses **Groqâ€™s advanced LLM** to analyze both textual and visual medical data.  
- **Efficient Search with FAISS**: Enables **fast and accurate** information retrieval from medical datasets.  
- **Seamless User Experience**: Designed for accessibility, ensuring **instant AI-driven medical support**.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Vector Search**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)  
- **AI Models**: Hugging Face NLP & Groqâ€™s multimodal LLM  
- **Text & Image Processing**: OpenCV, PIL, NumPy  
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for an interactive user experience  

## Installation
